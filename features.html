      <h1 id="birth">⤷ Birth of Helianthus</h1>
      <p>
        From the Dark Pits, a little drop of light pushed out. Neither god nor beast, it radiates warmth like a dying star. It speaks in tongues. It dreams in clouds. And it watches. From its birth it has enjoyed suffering, and now it will enjoy your suffering. Easily upset, you best worship it or suffer its wrath.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h1 id="houses">⤷ The Five Houses</h1>
      <p>
        The world is pulled in different directions by many powers. Among them, three nations stand out the most.
        Leria is ruled by a Tzar and his family. They sent to the New World the people now known as House Demeter to spread their religion and their philosophy of agricultural dominion.
        The Covenant is a network of Academies spread across the world, bound together by their hunger for power. Ruled by the Supreme Arch Mage, they sent a group now known as House Theurgy to the New World to hunt down magical artifacts and knowledge and bring it back.
        Then there’s STONE.corp. A massive company stretching across multiple regions with one goal and one goal only. Strip the earth of every last resource and turn it into profit. They sent a team now called House Adamant to do exactly that in the New World.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br><h3><strong style="color: darkorange">House Demeter:</strong></h3>
      <strong>Personality:</strong> Peaceful. Proud. Almost cult-like in their calm. They speak of "the soil" as if it were sacred.
      <br><strong>Building Style:</strong> Rural agrarian with religious undertones. Think terraced farms, windmills, stone chapels covered in vines. Earth tones like mossy cobble, coarse dirt, stripped oak. Banners with wheat or golden sun motifs. Interiors filled with books, bread, and crop offerings. Every home feels lived in, old, and worshipful.
      <br>Use bees, hanging lanterns, and lush greenery. Fields aren't just farms, they're shrines.

      <br><h3><strong style="color: purple">House Theurgy:</strong></h3>
      <strong>Personality:</strong> Obsessed. Coldly curious. Their wonder is intellectual, not emotional. They feel nothing for the land, only what can be learned or twisted. It's all experiment, no certainty.
      <br><strong>Building Style:</strong> Arcane gothic. Blackstone, deep slate, warped wood. Spires and dark towers, ritual circles, glowing purple veins. Symbols everywhere like enchantment tables, crying obsidian, lecterns full of forbidden texts.
      <br>Use soul fire, dripstone, and candles for an eerie atmosphere. Rooms are functional, not cozy. Every block feels placed with purpose. Even their gardens are alchemical.

      <br><h3><strong style="color: darkblue">House Adamant:</strong></h3>
      <strong>Personality:</strong> Cold. Efficient. Dominating. They don’t care about the land, the people, or the cost. Everything is a system to be optimized. Progress is profit.
      <br><strong>Building Style:</strong> Hyper-industrial and fully automated. Their bases feel more like machines than buildings. Think massive steampunk megastructures humming with redstone circuits, gears, and pipes. Sorting systems. Auto-smelters. Drill rigs powered by lava or fuel cells.
      <br>Farms are fully automated with machinery. Even tree farms are mechanized. Every block is placed in care for Utility. Their mines/homes look like surgical wounds in the world.

    <div class="section-block">
      <h1 id="siege">⤷ The Eternal Siege</h1>
      <p>
        The mobs have changed. No longer beasts. No longer hollow.
        <br>Helianthus, in his unknowable will, breathed consciousness into their empty forms. A cruel gift. Now they think. They speak in silence. They move with purpose. Packs swarm like wolves, flank close in like soldiers. One distracts. One surrounds. One kills.
        <br>They do not sleep. They do not retreat. Their only reason to exist is to tear you into pieces.
        <br>
        <br>Some say the fire around the spawn temple burns with divine intent. A boundary set by Helianthus himself, to hold back the creatures. Within the flames, a fragile peace remains. Traders whisper deals. Outsiders huddle in corners. Old enemies exchange food instead of blood. All kept alive by fear of the ones waiting outside.

        <br>They call it the Siege. But this is not a war. This is a massacre. The mobs yearn for our flesh.

        <br>And they want us to know it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h1 id="role">⤷ Player Role</h1>
      <p>
        You arrive in the dark with a gift from Helianthus. Your task: choose a House and claim relics. But most importantly.. Hold Dominion over the New World, only one House can truly win.
