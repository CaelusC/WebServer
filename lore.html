          <p>Before anything, there was the void. Then from somewhere beneath it, a light pushed through. Neither warm
            nor kind, just bright, and watching.</p>

          <p>Helianthus is not a god you worship for blessing. He does not answer prayers. He does not protect. He watches, and when the watching bores him, he acts. His actions are never merciful.</p>

          <p>What he wants is simple: suffering and spectacle. Keep him entertained and he may let you live another day. Bore him, and he will burn everything you've built and start again. He has done it before.</p>

          <p>Do not pray to Helianthus. Do not ask him for anything. Simply endure, and hope he finds your struggle amusing.</p>

          <p>You will not remember how you got here.</p>

          <p>The vortex, a passage between the Old World and this one, does something to the mind. Those who pass
            through arrive in a fog, memories scattered, some believing they were born from Helianthus himself. This is not true. You came from somewhere else. You were sent.</p>

          <p>At the Temple of Sun, a priest waits. He will speak to you of Helianthus. He will call the sun god your
            creator, your father, your purpose. He will place bread in your hands 'the Body of Helianthus'. Telling
            you it is a gift. Eat it. You will need it to survive the first days.</p>

          <p>The priest believes every word he speaks. He sees beauty in suffering, glory in dominion. He will wish you victory, but he does not care if you achieve it. He is there for the show, same as his god.</p>

          <p>Read the old texts. Speak to those who came before you. Learn the truth of where you came from, or don't. It changes nothing about what you must do next.</p>

          <h2 class="c-card__title">IV. The Three Children</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="c-card__body">
          <p>When Helianthus burned the old world and built this one from its ashes, he did not come alone. He made
            three children, gods in their own right, though twisted reflections of what gods should be.</p>

          <p>In the Old World, there were stories of Justice, of War, of Death. Noble concepts, if cruel. Helianthus took those ideas and broke them.</p>

          <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: var(--color-bg-card); border-radius: 8px;">
            <p><strong>Scythia, Goddess of Punishment</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Where Justice weighs and balances, Scythia only hurts. She does not care who deserves what. She wants pain delivered, and she will reward those who deliver it.</p>
          </div>

          <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: var(--color-bg-card); border-radius: 8px;">
            <p><strong>Leonidas, God of Conflict</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">War, once, had honor, strategy, purpose. Leonidas wants none of that. He
              wants violence for its own sake. Betrayal, chaos, blood spilled without reason. The fight is the point
              .</p>
          </div>

          <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: var(--color-bg-card); border-radius: 8px;">
            <p><strong>Bremen, God of Expiration</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Death ends things. Bremen wants them to rot first. He governs decay, obsolescence, the slow ruin of everything that overstays its welcome. Nothing is allowed to last.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Around Helianthus's Heart, three monuments rise in a triangle. One for each child. These are not temples.
            They are altars.</p>

          <p>At each monument, a board of deeds waits. Tasks. Quests. Sacrifices. The children do not ask for nice
            things. They ask for betrayal, destruction, cruelty, offerings that cost you something real. Complete a
            deed in public (Helianthus loves a show) and the god may grant you a gift or a favor. What you receive
            depends on what you gave and how much it hurt to give it.</p>

          <p>Any envoy, from any House, may approach any monument. The children do not care about factions. They care about what you're willing to do.</p>

        <div class="c-card__body">
          <p>The creatures of this world are not mindless.</p>

          <p>Helianthus, in some unknowable cruelty, gave them thought. They hunt. They flank, surround, coordinate. One distracts while another closes in. They learn.</p>

          <p>At night they emerge. Near Helianthus's Heart, they are manageable, predictable. The
            further you travel from the center, the stronger they become. Out at the edges of the known world, things live that should not be challenged without preparation and numbers.</p>

          <p>Scattered across the land, demigods dwell in hidden places, throne rooms buried in the earth, towers
            forgotten by time. These are not mere monsters. They are powerful, ancient, and they guard treasures worth dying for. The items that made them strong can make you strong too, if you can take them.</p>

          <p>There is no stopping the siege. There is no final victory against it. Just try to survive.

        </div>
        <div class="c-card__body">
          <p>Before the vortex opened, there was only the Old World. It was small, crowded, already carved up by powers
            that
            tolerated no rivals.</p>

          <p>Three factions ruled there, and rule there still:</p>

          <p><strong>Leria</strong> — An empire governed by a Tzar and his bloodline. They believe in order, tradition, and agricultural dominion. They sent colonists to spread their faith and their way of life. Those colonists became <strong>House Demeter</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>The Covenant</strong> — A network of arcane academies bound by hunger for power. The Supreme Arch Mage sent scholars and warlocks to the New World seeking artifacts and forbidden knowledge. They became <strong>House Theurgy</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>STONE.corp</strong> — A company with no nation, only profit. They strip land to the bone and move on. They sent a team to do the same here. That team is <strong>House Adamant</strong>.</p>

          <p>These three powers know about each other. They have always known. The vortex is a competition. Each faction sends envoys, and those envoys send back resources, items, and knowledge to their masters. That is why they keep coming. That is why you are here.</p>

          <p>You are an envoy. Your House is your faction. Your masters expect returns on their investment.</p>

      <!-- THE CLEANSING -->

          <h2 class="c-card__title">VII. The Cleansing</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="c-card__body">
          <p>This is not the first world Helianthus has made.</p>

          <p>Before this one only Helianthus himself knows how many there were. Envoys came, built, fought, survived.
            For a time, it worked. Then it stopped
            working. The conflict grew stale. The suffering became routine. Helianthus grew bored.</p>

          <p>So he burned it. All of it. Every structure, every alliance, every envoy who thought they had built something permanent. He reduced it to ash and built this world on top of it.</p>

          <p>Almost no one survived. Those who hid deep enough, long enough. Emerged into a world remade. They are
            few. Merek the Crooked is one of them. You may see him at some point, usually at the tavern in the
            Temple of Sun, a
            scorched man
            with
            old eyes. Sometimes he speaks of what he saw. If you buy him enough ale that is</p>

          <p>Learn from what happened. Keep Helianthus entertained. Keep him watching. The moment his attention
            wanders, the moment he finds this world as boring as the last, it will happen again.</p>

          <p>You are not just here to survive. You are here to make sure survival remains possible.</p>

        <div class="c-card__body">
          <p>You arrive with nothing but fog in your head and bread in your hands. What you do next is up to you.</p>

          <p><strong>Choose a House.</strong> This cannot be undone. Your House is your people, your economy, your war and your peace. Their strength is yours. Their enemies are yours.</p>

          <p><strong>Survive.</strong> The land wants to kill you. The creatures want to kill you. Sometimes your neighbors will want to kill you. Find ways to keep breathing.</p>

          <p><strong>Build.</strong> Claim territory. Gather resources. Construct what your House needs to thrive.</p>

          <p><strong>Dominate.</strong> There is no peace here. Only temporary arrangements. One House will rise
            above the others. Richest, strongest, most feared. That is what dominion means. That is what Helianthus
            wants to watch.</p>

          <p><strong>Entertain him.</strong> Fight. Betray. Sacrifice. Build empires and tear them down. Do whatever it takes to keep his eyes on you, because the alternative is another cleansing, and this time you won't be deep enough to survive it.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Go now. Your House is waiting. Helianthus is watching.</p>
